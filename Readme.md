## 📌 Project Description
HerSafeWay is a web-based application designed to help users find the safest routes in Indian cities using crime data. By integrating Firebase authentication, mapping services, and a crime dataset, it provides secure navigation by avoiding high-crime areas.

---
## 🚨 The Problem Statement
Finding safe routes, especially for women and vulnerable individuals, is a major challenge in urban areas due to crime hotspots. Current mapping services prioritize speed, but not safety.

---
## 🛡️ The Solution
HerSafeWay provides the safest possible route by analyzing crime data and dynamically avoiding dangerous areas. Users can enter their start and destination locations, and the system calculates a secure route, displaying crime zones and alternative paths.
